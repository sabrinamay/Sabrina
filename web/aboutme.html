                    <!--                <p1> It is the American dream that says "when you grow up, you can be anything". And when you grow up, you begin to ask questions. Questions about life, government, and ideas that adults say "you'll understand when you're older".</p1>-->
                    <!--                <p2> Now that I am older, I have to admit, I have no answers. Just more questions. </p2><br><br>-->
                    <p3>Christine (the girl in the photo above) and I would study calculus in the freshman lounge, where our peers would run in screaming "this is sparta". While they declared war upon another dorm floor, Christine and I would attack the numbers on our pages and bond over our struggle in academics. I felt comfortable enough to tell her my struggles. That was when she opened up about how she had dyslexia and referred me to the Disability Student Services office on campus. After a thorough and exhausting process—I was confirmed to have a reading disability.</p3><br><br>

                    <p4> At this moment, I realised the value of my education and how it is a privilege to better myself:<section class="underline"><br> I have the power to answer all the questions I have. <br>I have the power to choose what I do and discover what I love.</section>
                    </p4>
                    <br>
                    <p5> Christine not only gave me resources, she gave me courage. This is why I value education and service; it's helping an individual not only by teaching them what to do, but by making the process easier. Inspiring them to get over any obstacle and to communicate different goals and objectives.</p5>
